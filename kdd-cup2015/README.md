Background: 

Students' high dropout rate on MOOC platforms has been heavily criticized, and predicting their likelihood of dropout would be useful for maintaining and encouraging students' learning activities. Therefore, in KDD Cup 2015, we will predict dropout on XuetangX, one of the largest MOOC platforms in China.  



Description：

The competition participants need to predict whether a user will drop a course within next 10 days based on his or her prior activities. If a user C leaves no records for course C  in the log during the next 10 days, we define it as dropout from course C For more details about log, please refer to the Data Descriptions.
